My first game in Windows Forms - Made for a school project!

This game features things a real car does, such as a gas, brake, even a handbrake and cruise control. It even makes sure a key is in before starting the game.

Your steering wheel is a slider. You can click or drag on the slider to change your car's lane. Your obstacles are another set of vehicles, and if you *touch* them, you crash and the game ends.

The game has no end. There are no scores. The point of this game is to experiment with WinForms and *not* do boring assignments like calculating the surface of a square or a circle.
